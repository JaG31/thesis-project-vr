This is the official repository for my Undergraduate Thesis project.

The goal is to create a VR simulation of the CSCI-2050 computer architecture lab

This includes setting up a breadboard, raspberry pi, wires, resisitors, buttons etc in VR, and allowing the user to make a circuit on the breadboard and run a python script outputting to the GPIO pins of this virtual pi.
